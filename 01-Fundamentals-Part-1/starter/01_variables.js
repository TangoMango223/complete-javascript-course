// Values & Variables in JavaScript
// let js = "amazing";
// if (js == "amazing") alert("Hi Christine!");
// console.log("Hey Christine!!");

// console.log(23);
// console.log("Jonas");

// Variable declaration
let first_name = "Bob" // Declare a variable, like in Python

// We have a box, called first name, like Jonas
// If we want to use it, use the name first_name, like Jonas
// Similar to SQL, if you'd like to 

console.log(first_name);
console.log(first_name);
alert(first_name); // This will fail if you use firstName since it's not declared until later on.


// Similar to Python, JS reads up to down.

// Notation for naming
// camelCase is more common in JavaScript
// In Python, it's common to use underscores like under_score


let firstName = "Christine"
let first_name_hahaha = "Python"
let first_name_like_this = "SQL"

// Illegal names - cannot start with keywords or numbers
// Read error messages
// let 3years = 3;


// Also illegal - fix with $ or underscore _
let _function = 27;
let $function = 27

// Let names - not a good idea, it's very generic.
let first_name_like_blah = "Jonas";

// Never start with uppercase. It's a convention, very illegal
// Just use the snake method in Programming

// upper case - for OOP, Classes, Constants, reserved for it
let Person = "Constants";

// Real constant, right it in upper case like this
let PI = 3.1415;

// Make sure variable names are descriptive
// First name, my_first_job > job, since it's more descriptive.
let my_first_job = "Programmer"
let job = "programmer"

// Practice:
let country = "Canada";
let continent = "North America";
let population = 50000000;

// Show these values in the console:
console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);
