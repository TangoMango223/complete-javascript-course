// Loops and Iterations in JS

// Important for automation and following DRY sometimes
// This is shit code LOL
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');
// console.log('Lifting weights, repetition 1 🤸‍♀️');


// For Loops in JavaScript - Syntax
// Set loop stop condition - will happen until no longer TRUE
// Syntax: for (var initialization; set loop stop condition; rep = rep + 1)
for(let rep = 1; rep <= 30; rep++){
    console.log(`Lifting weights, repetition ${rep} 🤸‍♀️`);
}

// Dev tools shows that the print has happened 10 times!

for (initialization; condition; increment) 
    {
        // code to be executed 
        }
